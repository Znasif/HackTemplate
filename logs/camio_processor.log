Explanation of Changes and How They Help:

cleanupAudioResources() Function:

This new function centralizes the logic for stopping audioStream tracks, nullifying mediaRecorder and audioStream objects, removing event listeners from mediaRecorder, and updating the UI state.
This ensures that resources are consistently released and state is correctly reset, whether stopping normally, due to an error, or during a restart.
Promise-based stopAudioStreaming():

Now returns a Promise that resolves when mediaRecorder.onstop is fired. This is crucial because mediaRecorder.stop() is asynchronous.
It ensures that any subsequent actions (like starting a new recording) only occur after the previous MediaRecorder has fully finished its lifecycle (including firing any final ondataavailable events).
The audio_stream_stop message to the server is now sent after the local mediaRecorder.onstop event, ensuring the client has finished with the recorder before signaling the server.
Error handling for the stop process itself is included.
Improved startAudioStreaming():

More robust checks (e.g., !streamReady || !audioStream) before proceeding.
Calls cleanupAudioResources() in its main catch block to ensure that if startAudioStreaming fails at any point, resources are properly released.
mediaRecorder.onstart and mediaRecorder.onerror handlers are kept for better diagnostics.
Refined restartAudioStreaming():

Uses await stopAudioStreaming() to ensure the previous session is fully stopped.
A brief setTimeout (e.g., 150ms) is retained after stopping and before starting a new stream. While mediaRecorder.onstop should signal completion, this small delay can act as an extra safeguard for any browser-internal asynchronous operations or resource releases that might not be perfectly synchronized with the onstop event. This is often a pragmatic choice in complex media scenarios.
Handles the case where audio wasn't streaming by simply starting it.
Includes error handling for the restart sequence and ensures cleanup if it fails.
setupAudioStream() Enhancement:

Explicitly sets audioStream = null; before attempting to get a new stream if one already exists, further clarifying the intent to get a completely fresh stream.
To Implement These Changes:

Replace your existing startAudioStreaming, stopAudioStreaming, restartAudioStreaming, and toggleAudioStreaming functions with the new versions.
Add the new cleanupAudioResources function.
Ensure that updateStatus, toggleAudioButton, and ensureWebSocketConnection are correctly defined and accessible in your script.
The audioInputSelect and videoFeed related lines are kept for context but ensure these elements exist if the functions using them are called.
By making these changes, you significantly increase the robustness of your client-side audio handling. This should reduce the likelihood of sending corrupted WebM data on subsequent recording attempts, thereby resolving the server-side FFmpeg error and the "no audio heard" issue. Remember to also use the server-side diagnostic improvements (preserving the faulty .webm file) if the problem persists, as this will help pinpoint the nature of any remaining data corruption.
